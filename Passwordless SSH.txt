Passwordless SSH 

On NameNode:

1. First generate key pair.
   cmd: ssh-keygen -t rsa (this will generate to files in ~.ssh/ name ira)

2.  cd ~.ssh/
    id_rsa (private) id_rsa.pub (public)
	
3.  Now create file named authorized by copying id_rsa.pub
    cmd: cp id_rsa.pub authorized_keys

4. change permission of authorized_keys
   cmd: chmod 600 authorized_keys
 
5. Copy ids to DataNode using cmd
   cmd: ssh-copy-id DataNode (it will ask for password ...enter password)

6. Now goto DataNode and see if there id dir .ssh in ~
   and there authorized_keys must be present.
   (verify contents of authorized_keys in DataNode & NameNode
     using cat they must be same).

7. now ssh to DataNode via NameNode
   cmd: ssh DataNode
   it's passwordless now

On DataNode:

1.  ssh NameNode it will ask for password.

2. In DataNode ~/.ssh only authorized_keys is present
   private key is not(we need to copy private key(id_rsa)
   from NameNode to DataNode.

3. In NameNode open .ssh/id_rsa
   cmd: cat .ssh/id_rsa
   it will show key.

4. copy the content and paste this in DataNode .ssh
   with the file name id_rsa
   cmd: vi id_rsa
        copy key & save it
5. now change permission of this file to 600
   cmd: chmod 600 id_rsa

6. Now ssh to NameNode from DataNode 
   cmd: ssh NameNode
   
   it's done.
